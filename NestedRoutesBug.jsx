In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when you have nested routes and try to use the `useParams` hook to access parameters from a parent route within a child route.  If the parent route's parameter is not also present in the child route's path, `useParams` in the child component might return an empty object or an unexpected value. This typically happens because the child route's path does not explicitly include the parent route's parameter in its definition.
