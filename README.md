This repository demonstrates a common issue and its solution when working with nested routes and the useParams hook in React Router v6. The bug showcases how useParams might fail to retrieve parent route parameters in a child component if the child route's path isn't properly structured. The solution provides a corrected route structure to ensure proper parameter inheritance.  The bug and solution are implemented in separate files for clarity.
